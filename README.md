# PII Remover

This is project made by the team at [RoboCop](https://getrobocop.com/) to help remove PII from documents.

## What happens to my data? How is PII removed

At no point in the PII removal process is data ever collected by anyone. We have made this project bare bones and public on github to make this point clear

The only service used is Azure Gov's [PII recognition tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/personally-identifiable-information/overview). Data is never stored and is encrypted in transit, as per the PII service [security rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/language-service/data-privacy?context=/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/context/context#how-is-data-retained-and-what-customer-controls-are-available)

No data is stored and data is encrypted in transit as confirmed by the securty rules and the email chain below:
